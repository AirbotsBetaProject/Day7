1. Learned about working of deep learning convolutional neural networks.
2. Read a research paper - Multimodal Emotion Detection using emoFBVP dataset. Currently unable to download dataset from site https://emofbvp.org
3. The research paper has indicated better accuracy for CK+ database.
4. Wrote a code based on deep learning cnn for emotion recognition, inspired from program for lenet-mnist deep cnn.
5. Run the code for 25 epochs initially. Accuracy - 72.81%
6. train_accuracy.txt shows training accuracy after every epoch for 25 epochs. test_accuracy.txt shows testing accuracy after every 5 epochs for 25 epochs.
7. To-Do : Get better accuracy by training for higher number of epochs.
